                        had a desiring purpose. Our story started with a group of programmers whos sole
                        mission was to create a fully functioning and robust Web Development product. From that task
                        that group not only saw a Web product but a way to tackle a rising issue in todays population. Food Insecurity!
                        Through their combined knowledge they produced a product that defines the very idea that "surplus food" could serve
                        as the tool in waging the war against Food Insecurity
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="secondary-color bold"><span class="indent">C</span></span>atch</span><span class="tertiary-color">And</span><span class="primary-color">Deliver</span>
                        is a conduit that brings fresh clean produce and prepared food from credible local businesses to their local non profit 
                        distribution and food bank locations. Our program assist food insecure communities to have access nutrition that fits their needs.
