                    <p>Once upon a time ...the world was connected</p>

                    <p>And every day … people said hello to their neighbors as they 
                        came home from work and brought their favorite dish to the 
                        block party. When someone was sick, neighbors brought soup. 
                        When someone new moved in, they were welcomed to the 
                        neighborhood. We celebrated our lives and our community.

                        <p>Because of that … we don’t know our neighbors. We don’t bring them soup. We 
                            don’t know that William’s mother is too sick to cook.  We don’t know that 
                            he will go hungry tonight.
